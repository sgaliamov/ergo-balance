# edBalance

A complementary utility for [edLayout](https://github.com/sgaliamov/ergo-layouts).

It has an implementation of a genetic algorithm that looks for an "optimal" balance of keys on a keyboard.

Don't ask why...

## Plan

1. Find stable layouts on 29.
1. Use them on 123 and find next stable.
1. Use results on big text.
1. Do same with all unblock keys.
