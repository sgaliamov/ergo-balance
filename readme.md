# edBalance

A complementary utility for [edLayout](https://github.com/sgaliamov/ergo-layouts).

It has an implementation of a genetic algorithm that looks for an "optimal" balance of keys on a keyboard.

Don't ask why...

## To do

1. Remove duplicates.
1. Save and load results.
1. Make keys more balanced.
