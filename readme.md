# edBalance

A complementary utility for [edLayout](https://github.com/sgaliamov/ergo-layouts).

It has an implementation of a genetic algorithm that looks for an "optimal" balance of keys on a keyboard.

Don't ask why...

## State

The project is frozen now for the next reasons:

1. When move buttons, other layouts are broken.
1. When use MKLC, shortcuts stays in same places, which is confusing.
