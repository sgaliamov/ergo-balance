# edBalance

A complementary utility for [edLayout](https://github.com/sgaliamov/ergo-layouts).

It has an implementation of a genetic algorithm that looks for an "optimal" balance of keys on a keyboard.

Don't ask why...

## Plan

1. Review schema.
1. Run on 100% valid schema.
1. Do same with all unblock keys.
1. Write review post.
1. Clean redundant code.
1. Write post about genetic algorithm.
